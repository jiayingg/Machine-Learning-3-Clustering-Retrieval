# Machine Learning - Clustering and Retrieval

Clustering and retrieval are some of the most high-impact machine learning tools out there. Retrieval is used in almost every applications and device we interact with, like in providing a set of products related to one a shopper is currently considering, or a list of people we might want to connect with on a social media platform. Clustering can be used to aid retrieval, but is a more broadly useful tool for automatically discovering structure in data, like uncovering groups of similar patients.

The topics covered include:
- Nearest neighbors with LSH implementation
- K-means
- KD-trees
- Expectation-maximization (EM)
- Mixtures of Gaussians
- Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) 
- Hierarchical clustering
